- **Multiple component states**: Explore different states and variations of components
- **Development playground**: Test components without running the full application

### Available Stories

- **Components/LoadingPlaceholder**: 3D loading indicator component
- **Components/ModelInfo**: Model information display with TSL rendering features
- **Components/ThumbnailDisplay**: Thumbnail display states (ready, processing, failed, placeholder)
- **Components/Model List/EmptyState**: Empty state for model library
- **Components/Model List/ErrorState**: Error handling component for testing different error scenarios

### Running Storybook

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm run storybook
```

Access Storybook at http://localhost:6006

### Building Storybook

To build a static version of Storybook for deployment:

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm run build-storybook
```

The static files will be generated in `src/frontend/storybook-static/`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to the codebase
2. **Build**: `dotnet build Modelibr.sln`
3. **Test**: `dotnet test Modelibr.sln --no-build`
4. **Run**: Start both API and frontend for testing
5. **Validate**: Ensure upload functionality works correctly

## üê≥ Docker Development

For development with hot reloading:

```bash
# Frontend development mode
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up frontend

# Full development stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Docker Health Check Issues
If you encounter "container webapi is unhealthy" errors:

1. **Verify health endpoint**: Test manually with `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
2. **Check logs**: Use `docker compose logs webapi` to see startup issues

### Common Issues
- **Database connection errors**: Ensure PostgreSQL container is running and healthy
- **Port conflicts**: Make sure ports 3000, 8080, 5432, and 3001 are available (port 8081 only needed for local HTTPS development)
- **Upload permission errors**: Set `UPLOAD_STORAGE_PATH` to a writable directory
- **Thumbnail worker "no such file" error**: If you see `exec /app/docker-entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory`, this was caused by Windows line endings. **The issue is now fixed** - simply rebuild the container with `docker compose build thumbnail-worker`. The Dockerfile automatically converts line endings. See [docs/WORKER.md](docs/WORKER.md#troubleshooting) for details
