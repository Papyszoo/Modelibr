# Implementation Summary - Texture Set Merge Feature

## Issue Addressed
**Issue**: Merging texture sets together
**Description**: On texture set list when we grab one texture set card and drop it on another, we should see a modal about merging two texture sets. It should ask which texture type the dragged texture set is and take its albedo texture and put as selected type to a texture set which we dropped it on.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
   - Texture set cards are now draggable
   - Cards accept drops from other texture set cards
   - Visual feedback during drag (border highlight, opacity changes)
   - Distinguishes between file drops and texture set drops

2. **Merge Dialog**
   - Modal dialog appears when dropping one texture set on another
   - Shows source and target texture set names
   - Dropdown to select target texture type
   - Filters out texture types already in target set
   - Proper validation and error handling

3. **API Integration**
   - Uses existing `POST /texture-sets/{id}/textures` endpoint
   - No backend changes required
   - Automatically refreshes texture set list after merge

4. **User Experience**
   - Toast notifications for success/error
   - Validation messages:
     - Cannot drop on self
     - Source must have albedo texture
     - Target type must be available
   - Dialog state properly resets between uses

### 🎨 Visual Changes

#### Before
- Texture set cards were static
- Only file drag-and-drop supported
- No way to merge texture sets

#### After
- Texture set cards are draggable
- Hover over target shows blue border highlight
- Modal dialog for texture type selection
- Success toast on merge
- Automatic refresh after merge

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Drag-and-Drop Flow
```typescript
1. User grabs texture set card
   → handleCardDragStart()
   → Store dragged set in state
   → Set custom data transfer type

2. User hovers over another card
   → handleCardDragOver()
   → Validate it's a texture set drag
   → Show visual feedback

3. User drops on card
   → handleCardDrop()
   → Validate drop target
   → Check for albedo texture
   → Open merge dialog

4. User selects type and merges
   → handleMergeTextureSets()
   → Call API with fileId and type
   → Show success toast
   → Refresh list
```

#### State Management
```typescript
const [draggedTextureSet, setDraggedTextureSet] = useState<TextureSetDto | null>(null)
const [dropTargetTextureSet, setDropTargetTextureSet] = useState<TextureSetDto | null>(null)
const [dragOverCardId, setDragOverCardId] = useState<number | null>(null)
const [showMergeDialog, setShowMergeDialog] = useState(false)
```

#### API Call
```typescript
await ApiClient.addTextureToSetEndpoint(targetSet.id, {
  fileId: albedoTexture.fileId,
  textureType: selectedType
})
```

### ✅ Validation & Testing

#### Build Status
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Linting passes (only pre-existing warnings in other files)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No breaking changes

#### Code Review
- ✅ Addressed all code review feedback
- ✅ Removed duplicate validation
- ✅ Added state reset in dialog
- ✅ Proper error handling

#### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. ✅ Drag texture set onto itself → Shows warning
2. ✅ Drag texture set without albedo → Shows warning
3. ✅ Drag onto set with all types filled → Shows info message
4. ✅ Cancel merge dialog → Properly resets state
5. ✅ Successful merge → Shows success, refreshes list

### 📊 Code Quality

#### Metrics
- Total lines added: ~292
- Total lines modified: ~10
- Files changed: 5
- New components: 1
- Build time: ~7 seconds
- Bundle size: No significant change

#### Best Practices
- ✅ Clean Architecture maintained
- ✅ Reuses existing API endpoints
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ User feedback via toasts
- ✅ Proper state cleanup
- ✅ CSS follows existing patterns
- ✅ Component isolation

### 🔄 Integration Points

#### Existing Components
- Uses `TextureSetDto` from `src/frontend/src/types`
- Uses `getTextureTypeLabel` from `src/frontend/src/utils/textureTypeUtils`
- Uses `ApiClient` for API calls
- Uses PrimeReact components (Dialog, Dropdown, Toast)

#### No Backend Changes Required
- Uses existing endpoint: `POST /texture-sets/{id}/textures`
- Request/Response types already defined
- No database migrations needed

### 🚀 Deployment Notes

#### Frontend Deployment
1. Build passes successfully
2. No environment variable changes needed
3. No configuration changes required
4. Backward compatible (doesn't break existing functionality)

#### User Migration
- No user action required
- Feature is immediately available after deployment
- No data migration needed

### 📝 Documentation

#### User Documentation
- Visual guide created (TEXTURE_SET_MERGE_VISUAL_GUIDE.md)
- Feature documentation (TEXTURE_SET_MERGE_FEATURE.md)
- User flow diagrams included
- Example scenarios provided

#### Developer Documentation

2. Batch merge multiple textures at once
3. Undo/redo functionality
4. Drag preview showing thumbnail
5. Keyboard shortcuts for merge
6. Animation during drag
7. Copy vs Move options
