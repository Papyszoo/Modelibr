Preferences:
- Use browser automation as default UI verification.
- Shell commands are acceptable and helpful for investigation, but user wants them to run without approval (note: tool still requires confirmation).
- Use PR tools when working on any PR.
- For E2E/UI verification, prefer browser automation and gather console/network logs and screenshots.
- Use a subagent to scan frontend code and provide UI navigation guidance before browser verification.
