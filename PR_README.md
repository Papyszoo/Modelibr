# Fix: Model Viewer Tab Switching Issues

## Problem Statement
When switching between model viewer tabs, several critical issues occurred:
1. **Previous preview influences current one**: Camera position, model scale, and scene state persisted
2. **Models appear incorrectly**: Bigger/smaller than expected or floating around instead of rotating properly
3. **Same model in both panels**: Opening the same model in left and right panels caused it to disappear from one

## Solution Overview
Fixed by adding unique React keys to Three.js components to force proper unmounting/remounting and resetting model scaling state when models change.

## Technical Changes

### 1. ModelViewer.tsx
```tsx
// Added unique keys to Canvas and ModelPreviewScene
<Canvas key={`canvas-${model.id}-${side}`}>
  <ModelPreviewScene 
    key={`scene-${model.id}-${side}`}
    model={model} 
    settings={viewerSettings} 
  />
</Canvas>
```

### 2. ModelPreviewScene.tsx
```tsx
// Added unique keys to Model and OrbitControls
<Model key={modelUrl} modelUrl={modelUrl} ... />
<OrbitControls key={`orbit-${modelUrl}`} ... />
```

### 3. Model.tsx
```tsx
// Reset scaling state when model URL changes
useEffect(() => {
  scaledRef.current = false
}, [modelUrl])
```

## Why This Works

### React Key Strategy
- **Canvas key**: `canvas-{modelId}-{side}` ensures each model+panel combination gets a fresh Canvas instance
- **Scene key**: `scene-{modelId}-{side}` ensures scene is remounted when model or panel changes
- **Model key**: `{modelUrl}` ensures model loader state is reset for each unique file
- **Controls key**: `orbit-{modelUrl}` ensures camera controls are reset for each model

### Component Lifecycle
When React sees a key change:
1. Old component is unmounted → Three.js resources disposed
2. New component is mounted → Fresh Three.js context created
3. No state contamination between instances

### State Reset
The `scaledRef` now resets when `modelUrl` changes, ensuring:
- Models are always properly centered
- Scaling logic runs fresh for each load
- No position/scale persistence across loads

## Testing

### Automated
- ✅ Unit tests verify unique keys are applied
- ✅ Frontend build passes
- ✅ Linting passes

### Manual Testing Guide
See `docs/frontend/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive test scenarios:
1. Switch between multiple model tabs
2. Open same model in left and right panels
3. Rapid tab switching
4. Memory and performance validation

2. **MODEL_VIEWER_FIX.md** - Technical deep dive
3. **MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step testing procedures
4. **ModelViewer.test.tsx** - Unit tests for key props

## Impact

### Fixed Issues ✅
- Models no longer influence each other across tabs
- Consistent sizing and positioning
- Same model works in both panels simultaneously
- No memory leaks or resource contamination

### No Breaking Changes ✅
- All existing functionality preserved
- No API changes
- No backend changes required
- Fully backward compatible
