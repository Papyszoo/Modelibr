echo "✓ Added robust API connection retry logic with exponential backoff during worker startup"
echo "✓ Enhanced polling loop error handling to distinguish connection errors from other failures"
echo "✓ Improved connection resilience for Visual Studio debugging scenarios"
echo "✓ Worker will retry API connection up to 10 times with increasing delays (2s, 4s, 8s...)"

echo "The worker now handles the 'connect ECONNREFUSED' error gracefully by:"
echo "  1. Testing API connection on startup with retry logic"
echo "  2. Using exponential backoff for initial connection attempts"
echo "  3. Continuing to retry during polling with appropriate delays"
echo "  4. Logging connection issues as warnings rather than errors when appropriate"

echo "To test the full solution:"
echo "  docker compose up --build"

echo "The logs should show:"
echo "  1. Worker starts and tests API connection"
echo "  2. If API not ready, worker retries with increasing delays"
echo "  3. Once connected, worker begins normal job polling"
echo "  4. Any temporary connection issues are handled gracefully with retries"
