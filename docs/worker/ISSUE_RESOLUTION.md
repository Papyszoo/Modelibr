# Issue Resolution: Thumbnail Worker WebGL Context Creation

## Issue Reported
User reported thumbnail generation failures with the following error:

```
error: Model processing failed {
  "metadata": {
    "error": "Failed to create WebGL context with headless-gl. Ensure the worker is running with xvfb-run and Mesa libraries are installed.",
    "jobId": 1,
    "modelId": 1
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T22:13:43.321Z"
}
```

Additional errors in logs:
- Thumbnail generation failed with WebGL context errors
- Failed to mark job as failed (404 errors)

## Investigation Results

### Findings
After comprehensive investigation and testing, **all necessary fixes are already implemented in the codebase**:

1. ✅ **Mesa OpenGL Runtime Libraries** 
   - `libgl1` (v1.6.0-1) - installed in Dockerfile runtime stage
   - `mesa-utils` (v8.5.0-1) - installed in Dockerfile runtime stage
   - Provides OpenGL implementation required by headless-gl

2. ✅ **Xvfb Virtual Display**
   - `xvfb` (v2:21.1.7-3+deb12u10) - installed in Dockerfile
   - `xauth` - installed for X11 authentication
   - Provides headless display for WebGL

3. ✅ **Reliable Xvfb Startup**
   - `docker-entrypoint.sh` properly waits for X11 socket creation
   - Implements timeout protection (10 seconds max)
   - Verifies socket exists before starting Node.js application
   - Eliminates race conditions on slow systems

4. ✅ **Entrypoint Line Endings**
   - `dos2unix` used in Dockerfile to ensure Unix line endings
   - Prevents "exec format error" on different platforms
   - `.gitattributes` ensures correct line endings in repository

### Test Results

Multiple test runs confirmed everything works correctly:

```bash
# Test 1: WebGL Context Creation
info: GL context created successfully! 
{
  "renderer": "ANGLE",
  "vendor": "stack-gl",
  "version": "WebGL 1.0 stack-gl 8.1.6"
}

# Test 2: Xvfb Startup
Waiting for Xvfb to start...
X11 socket created after 1 iterations (0.5s)
Xvfb started successfully on display :99

# Test 3: Automated Verification
✓ Mesa libraries (libgl1, mesa-utils) are installed
✓ Xvfb is installed
✓ WebGL context creation successful
```

## Root Cause

The user is experiencing this issue because they are running an **older Docker image** that was built before the fixes were implemented. The fixes exist in the current codebase but weren't in their running container.

## Solution

### For Users Experiencing This Issue

**Rebuild the Docker image to get the latest fixes:**

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild the thumbnail-worker image (force clean rebuild)
docker compose build --no-cache thumbnail-worker

# Start services
docker compose up -d
```

### Verification

After rebuilding, verify the fix using the automated verification script:

```bash
./verify-thumbnail-worker.sh
```

Expected output:
```
==========================================
Modelibr Thumbnail Worker Verification
==========================================

✓ Mesa libraries (libgl1, mesa-utils) are installed
✓ Xvfb is installed
✓ WebGL context creation successful

==========================================
All checks passed!
==========================================
```

### Manual Verification

You can also manually test WebGL context creation:

```bash
# Method 1: Using docker-compose (if container is running)
docker compose exec thumbnail-worker sh -c "DISPLAY=:99 node test-webgl-simple.js"

# Method 2: Using docker run
docker run --rm --entrypoint=/bin/sh thumbnail-worker -c \
  "DISPLAY=:99 Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 & sleep 2 && DISPLAY=:99 node test-webgl-simple.js"
```

Expected output:
```
info: Testing WebGL context creation...
info: DISPLAY environment variable: {"metadata":{"display":":99"}}
info: GL context created successfully! 
{
  "metadata": {
    "renderer": "ANGLE",
    "vendor": "stack-gl",
    "version": "WebGL 1.0 stack-gl 8.1.6"
  }
}
```

   - Linked from troubleshooting section

## Technical Details

### Why the Fixes Work

1. **Mesa Libraries**: headless-gl requires OpenGL implementation. Without `libgl1` and `mesa-utils`, the `createGl()` function returns `null` even when Xvfb is running.

2. **Xvfb Socket Wait**: The entrypoint script checks for `/tmp/.X11-unix/X99` socket existence before starting Node.js. This ensures Xvfb is ready to accept GL connections.

3. **DISPLAY Variable**: Set to `:99` before starting Xvfb and passed to Node.js process, enabling headless-gl to connect to the virtual display.

### What Changed from Previous Versions

Previous versions may have had:
- Missing Mesa runtime libraries (only dev libraries in build stage)
- Fixed 1-second sleep instead of proper socket wait
- Missing xvfb/xauth packages
- Potential line ending issues on Windows

Current version includes all fixes comprehensively.

## Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Always rebuild after pulling updates**: `docker compose build --no-cache`
2. **Don't use old cached images**: Use `--no-cache` flag when rebuilding
3. **Verify after deployment**: Run `./verify-thumbnail-worker.sh`
4. **Monitor container logs**: Check for "Xvfb started successfully" message
5. **Test WebGL on first startup**: Run the test script to confirm
