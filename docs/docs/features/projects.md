# Projects

Projects in Modelibr let you group related assets together for organized workflows. A project can contain models, texture sets, sprites, and sounds — everything needed for a game level, scene, or creative work.

<div className="feature-video-container">
  <video controls width="100%" autoPlay muted loop>
    <source src="/Modelibr/videos/projects.webm" type="video/webm" />
    <p className="video-fallback">Demo video is being generated...</p>
  </video>
</div>

4. Click **Confirm** to add them to the project
