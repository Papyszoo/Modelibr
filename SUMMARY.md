# Upload Progress Window - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a global upload progress window for the Modelibr application that displays all file uploads with individual progress tracking, file metadata, and user actions.

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Global Upload Progress Tracking
- ✅ Context-based state management (`UploadProgressContext`)
- ✅ Tracks uploads across the entire application
- ✅ Persists state when switching between tabs
- ✅ Manages upload lifecycle (pending → uploading → completed/error)

### 2. Upload Progress Window UI
- ✅ Floating draggable window positioned at bottom middle
- ✅ Individual file progress bars with percentage
- ✅ File extension icons (image, model, document, etc.)
- ✅ File type icons (model, texture, generic file)
- ✅ File name and size display (formatted B/KB/MB/GB)
- ✅ Overall upload summary with total progress
- ✅ "Open in new tab" action for completed model uploads
- ✅ Remove individual uploads
- ✅ Clear all completed uploads
- ✅ Collapse/expand functionality
- ✅ Window stays open when switching tabs

### 3. Integration with Existing Upload Locations

All four upload locations now use the global progress window:

1. **ModelList** - Model file uploads
   - Uses enhanced `useFileUpload` hook
   - Validates Three.js renderability
   - Auto-tracks in global window

2. **PackViewer** - Model and texture uploads
   - Model uploads via `useModelUpload` hook
   - Texture uploads via `useGenericFileUpload` hook
   - Maintains pack association logic

3. **TextureSetList** - Texture file uploads
   - Uses `useGenericFileUpload` hook
   - Creates texture sets automatically

4. **TextureCard** - Individual texture uploads
   - Uses `useGenericFileUpload` hook
   - Replaces/adds textures to sets

### 4. Preserved Functionality
✅ Thumbnail generation for models
✅ Texture set creation and association
✅ Pack association for uploaded files
✅ File deduplication (hash-based)
✅ Validation and error handling
✅ Toast notifications for user feedback

## Technical Implementation

### New Components/Hooks Created
1. `UploadProgressContext.tsx` - Global state management
2. `useUploadProgress.tsx` - Hook to access context
3. `UploadProgressWindow.tsx` - Main UI component
4. `UploadProgressWindow.css` - Styling
5. `useGenericFileUpload.ts` - Hook for texture/file uploads
6. `useModelUpload.ts` - Hook for model uploads

### Enhanced Components
1. `useFileUpload.ts` - Added global progress support
2. `App.tsx` - Added provider and window component
3. `PackViewer.tsx` - Updated to use new hooks
4. `TextureSetList.tsx` - Updated to use new hooks
5. `TextureCard.tsx` - Updated to use new hooks

### Tests Updated
- `useFileUpload.test.ts` - Wrapped in UploadProgressProvider
- All existing tests pass (4 pre-existing failures remain)

## Build Status
✅ Build successful (no errors)
✅ Tests passing (same pre-existing 4 failures)
✅ Linting clean (only pre-existing warnings in other files)

## Usage

The upload progress window is automatically integrated. No changes needed to use it:

```tsx
// In any component wrapped by UploadProgressProvider (entire app)
import { useModelUpload } from '../../../shared/hooks/useModelUpload'

function MyComponent() {
  const { uploadModel } = useModelUpload()
  
  const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
    // Upload is automatically tracked in global window
    const result = await uploadModel(file)
  }
  
  return <input type="file" onChange={e => handleUpload(e.target.files[0])} />
}
```

## Window Behavior

1. **Auto-show**: Opens automatically when upload starts
2. **Persistent**: Stays visible across tab switches
3. **Draggable**: Can be moved within panel boundaries
4. **Collapsible**: Can minimize to header-only view
5. **Smart positioning**: Respects panel boundaries and tab bars
6. **Responsive**: Adapts to panel resize events

## Status Colors

- **Normal** (uploading): Light gray background
- **Completed**: Green background with checkmark
- **Failed**: Red background with error message

## Next Steps for User

1. The implementation is complete and ready for testing
2. Start the application to see the upload progress window in action
3. Try uploading files from different locations:
   - Model list page
   - Pack viewer (models and textures)
   - Texture set list
   - Texture card (individual textures)
4. Verify that:
   - Upload progress is displayed
   - Files can be opened in new tabs after upload
   - Window persists across tab switches
   - All existing functionality works (thumbnails, sets, packs)

## Known Limitations

- Window is currently positioned at bottom; can be enhanced to remember user position
- No upload pause/resume functionality (can be added later)
- No upload history persistence (clears on page refresh)

## Conclusion

The global upload progress window has been successfully implemented and integrated into all upload locations in the Modelibr application. The feature provides a unified, user-friendly interface for tracking file uploads while maintaining all existing functionality.
